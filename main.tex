\WorkEntry{Summer intern embedded developer}{Summer 2018}{Nordic Semiconductor}
{I made firmware to characterize the characteristics of receiving Bluetooth
packages and characterizing package loss, written in C. The firmware was
interrupt based and worked with the Direct Memory Access peripherals like the
Bluetooth radio. It was also branchless to ensure consistent behavior. The
results were made for making a simulator form estimatign package loss, written
in Python. The graphic surface made using tkinter.

the differing concepts of hydro-power production, so that they could be
translated properly.

build-scripts were in the Azure pipelines format, and in Bash and Powershell.

{Migrated hybrid Python/C++ from Python 3.8 to 3.9. I also fixed bugs related to
the Python Global Interpreter Lock using the Visual Studio as a post-mortem
debugger. The task also involved updating the Windows registry to set Visual
Studio or Windbg as the post-mortem debugger. The task also involved setting up
the Pyinstaller script, as well as making sure that the resulting protable
executable functioned. The task also approving external pull-requests and
making sure the project was in a good spot before it was retired.

%\WorkEntry{Software tester}{2023-present}{Nordic Semiconductor}{
%I helped increase our and our customer's confidence in the tools we made for doing DFUs and resetting nRF devices using Nordic's Python testing framework.
%The tests were done both on FPGAs and directly on hardware. I also worked on the CI/CD system using Jenkins/Bash for building and testing. Additionally, I made the Docker images we that ran the nodes controlling to the FPGAs.

% Tested tools used for firmware updates controlling nRF devices.
% - Verified that the changes worked as expected according to the product specification.
% - Testing on FPGA and on hardware.
% - Testing using a Bash/Python framework.
% - Created a build and a test system in Jenkins.
% - Creating Docker image to be used by Jenkins

%\WorkEntry{Software developer}{2020-2023}{Nordic Semiconductor}{
%I developed tooling for Windows, MacOS and Ubuntu, used internally and by customers, written in Rust.
%One of the tools was a bundler for making an isolated toolchain used for working with the nRF SDK. The tool greatly simplified the initial installation for our first-time users and increasing reproducibility for customer support.
%Additionally, I made our dynamic completion system more usable, taking execution time from 1 second to 0.3 seconds, profiling using ProcMon and Visual Studio.
%I also helped on updating one of our legacy C++ projects.
%% Finally. I worked on a multi-team project to make a Rust/Python program that used a built-in Python installation, while also limiting the scope of the project.

% % I developed cross-platform tooling used internally and by customers for developing our devices.
% % This included testing, profiling and parallelizing Rust, Python and Bash programs.

% I developed tooling for Windows, MacOS and Ubuntu, used internally and by customers for developing our devices. This includes tooling for collecting and bundling a portable toolchain for developing with Nordic's SDK, used by most users of Nordic's newer chips. The role also involved CI/CD systems in Azure Pipelines and Jenkins, as well as managed the releases of the aforementioned toolchains. The role also involved debugging and fixing multiprocess legacy applications in C++ and Python, as well as creating Docker images for building our tools.
% I also worked on a cross-team project, which involved making a portable Python program that integrated with our Rust tool suite and package manager. I also worked with profiling and optimizing our build tools and our autocompletion system.
