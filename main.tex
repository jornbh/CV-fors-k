\WorkEntry{Test tools for flashing, resettign and erasing development kits}{2024}{Nordic Semiconductor} { I made tests for our libraries and our CLI-tools that integrated with our Development Kits. The test-frameworks were pytest/pytest-bdd and Nordic's internal test framework. Pydebug remote was used for simplifying development, even on remote nodes, even allowing debugging on CI if need be. Tests were run on proper hardware and on FPGAs, flashing the netslist using proFPGA. The job also involved being up-to-date on the different devices, some of their different behavior and making sure the Jenkins nodes were running properly }
\WorkEntry{Set up Jenkins for building and testing}{2024}{Nordic Semiconductor} { I set up our Jenkins test and build pipelines. Most of the logic was made using Bash to keep the logic more portable between different CI vendors. }
\WorkEntry{Made proof of concepts for OAuth login}{2023}{Nordic Semiconductor} { I made an OAuth proof of concept for signing in to Azure with a Microsoft using Rust. }
\WorkEntry{Made an internal Rust registry}{2023}{Nordic Semiconductor} { I made an internal Cargo(Rust) package registry for publishing packages to our internal Artifactory. By using the Semantic versioning in Cargo, I made an ordering that allowed for nightly releases. I also made a system using GNU coreutils and Cargo, so that Jenkins could update the Git-repository on GitHub. }
\WorkEntry{Made Python/Rust tool made for estimating power-usage}{2022}{Nordic Semiconductor} { Expert code made using Python Anaconda needed to be embeddable in our modular CLI-tool. I helped push for using PyInstaller for exposing the Python code, finishing the project much faster. I also profiled and optimized the file-size, by monitoring all accessed files using ProcMon and then replacing the large SciPy linear algebra libraries with the ones form pip. This took the file-size from 250MB to 70MB, making the program much more usable. }
\WorkEntry{Add parent-process monitoring to long-running CLI tools}{2022}{Nordic Semiconductor} { In order to keep one of our C++ cli-tools from having orphaned child-processes when testing, it was required that the child monitored the parent. To observe and document the issue, Strace and kill and "ps" were used to observe and trigger the behavior. Solutions were made for Unix using process groups. On Windows, job objects were used to kill the children if the parent died. The task also involved pushing back against this solution, as simpler solutions could be made using queues in Boost. }
\WorkEntry{Add device-guessing for our command-line tools}{2023}{Nordic Semiconductor} { Added support in our Rust CLI tool for automatically guess what device to perform an operation on if there is only one connected device that the operation can be performed on. The work involved JSON Serialization/De-serialization using Rust Serde. }
\WorkEntry{Complete and optimize automatic completion system}{2022}{Nordic Semiconductor} { I helped finishing up our command completion system, as well as fixing bugs. I also fixed poor performance on Windows, by profiling time-usage and the timing of system calls using "Process Monitor". Visual Studio was also used for profiling. }
\WorkEntry{Create a portable toolchains for the nRF Connect SDK}{2022}{Nordic Semiconductor} { Made a Rust build-tool for making a portable toolchain for developing for Nordic semiconductor's nRF Connect SDK (Software Development Kit). In order to make toolchains for the different operating systems, things like Homebrew and apt were used. Async Rust with tokio was used in some cases for a speed-up. Also, chroot and FakeRoot were used to make the toolchain on Linux. }
\WorkEntry{Migrate and maintain legacy Python projects}{2021}{Nordic Semiconductor} {Migrated hybrid Python/C++ from Python 3.8 to 3.9. I also fixed bugs related to the Python Global Interpreter Lock using the Visual Studio as a post-mortem debugger. The task also involved updating the Windows registry to set Visual Studio or WinDbg as the post-mortem debugger. The task also involved setting up the PyInstaller script, as well as making sure that the resulting portable executable functioned. The task also approving external pull-requests and making sure the project was in a good spot before it was retired. }
\WorkEntry{Migrated build-systems from Jenkins to Azure pipelines}{2020}{Nordic Semiconductor} {I migrated and created build-pipelines for some of our tools to Azure pipelines, performing installations of the necessary tools, like vcpkg on Microsoft build-nodes. The nodes were Linux, MacOS and Windows. The build-scripts were in the Azure pipelines format, and in Bash and PowerShell. }
\WorkEntry{Helped maintain and debug C++ library}{2020}{Nordic Semiconductor} { I made improvements and debugged Nordic Semiconductor's internal library for communicating with nRF development kits. The tool was built using CMake, vcpkg and ninja. In order to simplify getting an overview of the project Doxygen was also used. }
\WorkEntry{Summer intern embedded developer}{Summer 2018}{Nordic Semiconductor} {I made firmware to characterize the characteristics of receiving Bluetooth packages and characterizing package loss, written in C. The firmware was interrupt based and worked with the Direct Memory Access peripherals like the Bluetooth radio. It was also branchless to ensure consistent behavior. The results were made for making a simulator form estimating package loss, written in Python. The graphic surface made using tkinter. }
\WorkEntry{Summer researcher}{Summer 2019}{SINTEF Energy Research} { I made a Python tool for translating the output in hdf format form SINTEF's short-term tool for optimizing hydro-power production to be compatible with their long-term tool for optimizing the same. The job involved learning the differing concepts of hydro-power production, so that they could be translated properly. }

%I helped increase our and our customer's confidence in the tools we made for doing DFUs and resetting nRF devices using Nordic's Python testing framework.
%The tests were done both on FPGAs and directly on hardware. I also worked on the CI/CD system using Jenkins/Bash for building and testing. Additionally, I made the Docker images we that ran the nodes controlling to the FPGAs.

%Additionally, I made our dynamic completion system more usable, taking execution time from 1 second to 0.3 seconds, profiling using ProcMon and Visual Studio.
%I also helped on updating one of our legacy C++ projects.
%% Finally. I worked on a multi-team project to make a Rust/Python program that used a built-in Python installation, while also limiting the scope of the project.
