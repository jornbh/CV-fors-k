\WorkEntry{Software Consultant}{2025-present}{Sopra Steria}{
I created Microsoft Azure infrastructure, using Terraform, as well as the
software running on it. Both Serverless Azure Functions using Python and hosted
withing Docker Container Applications. I also expanded the team's solution in
SQL, using SQLAlchemy, as well a monitoring solution, using Grafana and KQL.
Deployment was done using GitHub Actions and Terraform.

% Wrote some more tests
% Did some more work on the project code itself (WIll have to see if can say that part or not)
% Worked with setting up the Azure monitoring workspace
% Grafana workspace
% SQLAlchemy
% Scrum
% Kanban

}

\WorkEntry{Software tester}{2023-2025}{Nordic Semiconductor}{
I helped increase our and our customer's confidence in the tools we made for doing DFUs and resetting nRF devices using Nordic's Python testing framework.
The tests were done both on FPGAs and directly on hardware. I also worked on the CI/CD system using Jenkins/Bash for building and testing. Additionally, I made the Docker images we that ran the nodes controlling to the FPGAs.

% Tested tools used for firmware updates controlling nRF devices.
% - Verified that the changes worked as expected according to the product specification.
% - Testing on FPGA and on hardware.
% - Testing using a Bash/Python framework.
% - Created a build and a test system in Jenkins.
% - Creating Docker image to be used by Jenkins

}



\WorkEntry{Software developer}{2020-2023}{Nordic Semiconductor}{ I developed
tooling for Windows, MacOS and Ubuntu, used internally and by customers,
written in Rust. One of the tools was a bundler for making an isolated
toolchain used for working with the nRF SDK. The tool greatly simplified the
initial installation for our first-time users and increasing reproducibility
for customer support. Additionally, I made our our dynamic completion system
more usable, taking execution time from 1 second to 0.3 seconds, profiling
using ProcMon and Visual Studio. I also helped on updating one of our legacy
C++ projects, and set up a package registry for Rust packages using
Artifactory.

% Finally. I worked on a multi-team project to make a Rust/Python program that used a built-in Python installation, while also limiting the scope of the project.
% The tools were written in .
% Also helped maintain legacy C++ project.
% - Helped maintain nrfjprog (Multiprocess C++ project)
% - Made and maintained Azure/Jenkins pipelines.
% - Cross-team project, integrating Python code to be integrated with Rust
% - Profiling and optimizing build tools and autocompletion systems.
}


% \WorkEntry{Developed and maintained tooling for working with Nordic devices}{2020-present}{Nordic Semiconductor}{
% % Short
% % I developed cross-platform tooling used internally and by customers for developing our devices.
% % This included testing, profiling and parallelizing Rust, Python and Bash programs.

% I developed tooling for Windows, MacOS and Ubuntu, used internally and by customers for developing our devices. This includes tooling for collecting and bundling a portable toolchain for developing with Nordic's SDK, used by most users of Nordic's newer chips. The role also involved CI/CD systems in Azure Pipelines and Jenkins, as well as managed the releases of the aforementioned toolchains. The role also involved debugging and fixing multiprocess legacy applications in C++ and Python, as well as creating Docker images for building our tools.
% I also worked on a cross-team project, which involved making a portable Python program that integrated with our Rust tool suite and package manager. I also worked with profiling and optimizing our build tools and our autocompletion system.

% % low
% % This included creating and migrating Continuous Integration systems, as well as migrating them to Azure Pipelines and Jenkins
% % I was responsible for maintaining and deprecating our Python/C++ libraries and tools.



% % ##Things I have done in Nordic
% % - testing device-lib
% % - toolchain-bundler
% % 	- Building and releasing the toolchain bundles until another team was able to take the job in CI
% % 	- Parallelizing and simplifying for performance gains
% % - pc-ble-driver-py
% % - nrfutil
% % - azure pipelines
% % - nrfutil completion
% % - nrfutil device guessing
% % - Profiling nrfutil device and completion
% % 	- Linux and Windows
% % - Debug Linux and Microsoft processes
% % - NoVel
% % - Make docker images for building
% % - nrfutil npm
% % 	- Making Python project portable, and make it work with nrfutil
% % 	- Profiling size usage, file access and how to reduce it
% % 	- Contributed to the python project
% % - Testing util and probe lib
% % - setting up Jenkins

% Terse version of SINTEF
% \WorkEntry{Software developer, Summer student}{Summer 2019}{SINTEF Energy}{
% I made a Python tool for translating outputs from a short-term and a long-term hydropower-production optimization program, making them comparable.

% More detailed version of SINTEF
%\WorkEntry{Making a tool for comparing hydropower-production}{SINTEF Energy}{Summer 2019}{
%SINTEF Energy has two programs for planning how to most efficiently drain water reservoirs to get %the most out of the fluctuating water prices. Since one was a long-term model, while the other one was %more detailed, the job consisted of learning the models well enough, so that an automated program could be %made for translating the results from SHOP into the same format as the one for Prodrisk.

%Developing a simple simulator with GUI for package transmission for Bluetooth Low energy mesh so that % customers could get an idea of the performance of a star topology of BLE nodes. The job %included setting up experiments with NRF51 boards to gather data on the number of received %packets, and some of their properties. As well as setting up a simulator in Python able to give %distributions and percentiles for discovery time and throughput, given a given set of parameters given by %the user (Jitter, number of nodes, packet-length, etc.)
