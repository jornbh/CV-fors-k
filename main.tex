% \EducationEntry{Developed infrastructure for Continuous Integration and software}{2023-present}{Nordic Semiconductor}{
% I developed Continuous integration systems for Nordic's software using Jenkins.  
% }

\EducationEntry{Developed and maintained tooling for working with Nordic devices}{2020-present}{Nordic Semiconductor}{
% Short 	
% I developed cross-platform tooling used internally and by customers for developing our devices. 
% This included testing, profiling and parallelizing Rust, Python and Bash programs. 

I developed tooling for Windows, MacOS and Ubuntu, used internally and by customers for developing our devices. This includes tooling for collecting and bundling a portable toolchain for developing with Nordic's SDK, used by most users of Nordic's newer chips. The role also involved CI/CD systems in Azure Pipelines and Jenkins, as well as managed the releases of the aforementioned toolchains. The role also involved debugging and fixing multiprocess legacy applications in C++ and Python, as well as creating Docker images for building our tools. 
I also worked on a cross-team project, which involved making a portable Python program that integrated with our Rust tool suite and package manager. I also worked with profiling and optimizing our build tools and our autocompletion system. 

% low
% This included creating and migrating Continuous Integration systems, as well as migrating them to Azure Pipelines and Jenkins
% I was responsible for maintaining and deprecating our Python/C++ libraries and tools. 



% ##Things I have done in Nordic
% - testing device-lib 
% - toolchain-bundler 
% 	- Building and releasing the toolchain bundles until another team was able to take the job in CI 
% 	- Parallelizing and simplifying for performance gains
% - pc-ble-driver-py 
% - nrfutil 
% - azure pipelines 
% - nrfutil completion
% - nrfutil device guessing
% - Profiling nrfutil device and completion
% 	- Linux and Windows
% - Debug Linux and Microsoft processes 
% - NoVel 
% - Make docker images for building 
% - nrfutil npm 
% 	- Making Python project portable, and make it work with nrfutil 
% 	- Profiling size usage, file access and how to reduce it
% 	- Contributed to the python project
% - Testing util and probe lib 
% - setting up Jenkins

% More detailed version of SINTEF
%\EducationEntry{Making a tool for comparing hydropower-production}{SINTEF Energy}{Summer 2019}{
%SINTEF Energy has two programs for planning how to most efficiently drain water reservoirs to get %the most out of the fluctuating water prices. Since one was a long-term model, while the other one was %more detailed, the job consisted of learning the models well enough, so that an automated program could be %made for translating the results from SHOP into the same format as the one for Prodrisk.

%Developing a simple simulator with GUI for package transmission for Bluetooth Low energy mesh so that % customers could get an idea of the performance of a star topology of BLE nodes. The job %included setting up experiments with NRF51 boards to gather data on the number of received %packets, and some of their properties. As well as setting up a simulator in Python able to give %distributions and percentiles for discovery time and throughput, given a given set of parameters given by %the user (Jitter, number of nodes, packet-length, etc.)
